			<h2>The yPU Synthetic SoC</h2>
			<p><img src="yPU1.jpg" width="210" height="151" align="left" style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px;" >
			The yPU is a Synthetic System on a Chip is something I have 
			been working on for a long time, it is a complete computer on an FPGA that can be synthisized, 
			that is to say, compiled after using a super simple, user friendly GUI to pick all the peripherals
			that you want on your SoC. You simply drag and drop the desired resources to your target, compile and download
			and you have the perfect chip for you app. You want 16 RS232 ports, 8 PWM ports, whatever combo you need can be
			configured specifically for your app. The CPU is the ubiquotous 80186 core, but could be adapted to any. The 
			peripherals can be any Wishbone compatible IP cores, e.g. LCD driver, Touchscreen, Mouse, Keyboard, 100BaseT, 
			USB Host port, Wifi, 4G wireless, audio driver, PWM, RS232 ports, GPIO lines, SPI interface, system RAM, 
			SD card, graphics RAM, etc. (sorry no github files yet, waiting on some legalities).

			<h2>The Modapter</h2>
			<p><img src="modapter.jpg" width="210" height="151" align="left" style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px;" >
			The Modapter is a wireless modem adapter that allows 
			you to plug in any USB based wireless modem, 4G, 4G LTE, GSM, GPRS, CDMA and etc. and integrate
			that device into your MCU project even if your MCU does not have an OS or any USB drivers.
			The Modapter uses the same type of driver as typical Linux boards or Windows based computers
			use to interface with Wireless Modems but does not require the user to take on the task of 
			installing managing a full blown Linux Operating System. Instead, with Modapter, most of the 
			work is done for you, on the Modapter chip, so you can get your project up and on the Mobile 
			Internet as quicly as possible without fussing with Linux or other operating systems, drivers 
			or complexities.
			The Modapter sits between your MCU project and the Wireless Modem and provides a simple interface 
			to send and receive data over the internet.

			<h2>TabX1 Open Tablet Project</h2>
			<p><img src="board.jpg" width="210" height="170" align="left" style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px;">
			TabX1 is my attempt at creating 
			a cool Linux based tablet computer. The idea behind it is to create a functional
			tablet at a very low cost using a low cost low power SoC ARM chip and de-load
			much of the processing to an attached FPGA chip. <br><br>TabX1 is running Linux 2.6.36 
			with Busybox Filesystem, X11 Xwindows, Fluxbox desktop and I am using Rox Filer 
			and Netsurf browser. It has 5.7" Color LCD display with Touchscreen, Mouse, Keyboard,
			100BaseT, USB Host port, Wifi, 4G wireless, custom graphics driver (implemented on
			FPGA along with custom audio driver on FPGA), USB device, 4 RS232 ports, 32 GPIO lines
			Accellerometer, RTC, 64MBytes system RAM, SD card for disk, 8MB graphics RAM, etc 
			etc..

			<h2>The "zPhone Project"</h2>
			<p><img src="Image11.gif" width="219" height="128">
			<img src="Image2.gif"  width="208" height="146"></p>
			<p>The purpose of the "zPhone Project" is to create a hand held Ultra-Thin Client device 
      		operating over a wireless connection such as WiFi or 3G/4G high speed 
			wireless. An Ultra-Thin Client (UTC) is a client implemented in hardware. 
      		A thin client has no intelligence or computing power of its own and hence, 
      		relies completely on it’s server for operation. </p>
      		<p>The concept of a UTC is to implement the client completely in hardware, 
	  		specifically an FPGA to reduce the cost and power consumption of the device.
	  		A hardware implementation reduces cost since no software licensing, 
	  		operating system costs or programming costs are incurred for the device itself. </p>
      		<p>The power consumption is reduced since there is no need for a high speed 
	  		microprocessor and associated storage, memory and other support peripherals.
	  		The end result being that battery life is greatly enhanced. The highest power 
	  		consumption is incurred from the RF section. For this project, an 802.11b 
	  		mini-PCMIA interface card is selected. The 802.11b has reduced power consumption 
	  		over 802.11g/n because b uses a CDMA air interface which has a much lower 
	  		spectral density than the OFDMA scheme used by g/n.</p>

			<h2>4G LTE Embedded Linux Developers Kit</h2>
			<p><img src="linuxboard.jpg" width="184" height="136" align="left" style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px;">
			A Rapid Development and Delivery platform for 4G wireless embedded applications based on 
			Open Source / Open Hardware embedded Linux Debian Distro running on an Industry Standard
			ARM9 CPU. provides simple PHP, WEB back end to ease development.</p>

			<h2>FPGA Based Software Defined Radio</h2>
			<p><img src="Image5.png" width="203" height="151">
			<img src="Image3.gif" width="95" height="67">
			<img src="Image4.gif" width="99" height="75">
			</p>
			<p>An FPGA consists of a large array of Logic Elements (LE). Each LE contains basic 
      		building block of digital logic circuits (AND, OR, Flip Flop, etc). These 
      		arrays can be in the range of 10K – 100K or more LE’s. Other types of 
      		blocks may also be on the FPGA chip such as dedicated multipliers 
      		(important for DSP applications) or RAM and sometimes embedded 
      		microprocessor (e.g. ARM). All of the blocks can be arbitrarily 
      		interconnected to each other via the re-programmable interconnection. The 
      		challenge for the designer is to determine the optimal way to interconnect 
      		these blocks to achieve the design goal. Many computer aided tools have 
      		been developed to assist in this effort. </p>
      		<p>In this project, an SDR (Software Defined Radio) was simulated and synthesized 
	  		using Verilog HDL and implemented in a prototype set up. The design demonstrated 
	  		OFDM modulation scheme to transmit video images and further demonstrated that is
	  		software reconfigurable by altering in software to transmit NTSC video over standard 
	  		broadcast.  This project was used for Masters EE program project.</p>

			<a name="Apollo"></a>
			<h2>Apollo Guidance Computer Replica</h2>
			<p><img src="Image12.jpg" width="201" height="151"></p>
			<p>The AGC (Apollo Guidance Computer) was a very early computer, designed in 1964, it was 
	  		the first to use Integrated Circuits and the first modern embedded processor. When I was 
	  		growing up, about 11 years old, I remember the Apollo program was fascinating to me and 
	  		I had my eyes glued to the TV for days on end. The Moon landing made such a lasting 
	  		impression on me that it is why I decided to go to engineering school and get a degree 
	  		in Electrical Engineering. I used an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) that can think 
	  		of that as the equivalent of thousands of the TTL chips that is endlessly and completely 
	  		reconfigurable.  I used the Altera Cyclone FPGA which has a lot of memory right on the FPGA. 
	  		I also developed the user interface using a custom LCD controller using a CLPD and a 
	  		Microcontroller with a USB interface so code can be downloaded from your PC.

			<h2>The Zero Board Computer</h2>
			<p><img src="Image6.gif" width="212" height="141"></p>
			<p>ZBC is a PC-XT SoC (System on a Chip) that is implemented on an Altera Cyclone III FPGA. ZBC 
      		is intended to be fun and educational and able to run DOS and uCLinux. The 
      		motivation for this project was to emulate the Intel 80186 CPU using 
      		Verilog HDL and to synthesis a working computer by utilizing custom and 
      		open source (<a href="http://www.opencores.org/">www.opencores.org</a>
	  		peripheral IP Cores (Intellectual Property) to form a complete bootable SoC. 
	  		The completed project also implemented complete TCP/IP,UDP,HTTP,FTP,ARP,ICMP 
	  		stack in a driver called TinySOCK developed by me.

			<h2>Roto-Cell 2000:</h2>
			<p><img src="Image7.gif" width="175" height="151"></p>
			<p>The Roto-Cell 2000 is just a fun project that uses an old style Rotary 
			Phone with the original internal components removed and replaced with a cell phone bluetooth 
			adapter mounted on a PCB board and a micro-controller to interface the old style dialer and 
			ringer. The microcontroller translates the rotary dialed digits into RS232 commands that are 
			sent to the Bluetooth adapter to make a call and also receives messages from the Bluetooth adapter
			when a call comes in and rings the ringer. The Audio interface converts the old style carbon
			mic in the phone to the necessary levels to interface to the Bluetooth Module. You just pair
			it with whatever cell phone you want, you put your phone in your pocket and now you have yourself
			a wireless Rotary phone! For this project I used an old timey rotary phone that I bought at a 
			garage sale, but I have also seen them available online.

			<h2>Scanning Tunneling Microscope:</h2>
			<p><img src="Image9.png" width="224" height="168"></p>
			<p><img src="Image8.gif" width="46" height="46"></p>
			<p><b>Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM)</b> is a device by which atoms may be imaged using 
      		Quantum Tunneling. STM involves the tunneling of electrons through gap from the tip of the 
			STM to the sample. This can be considered as tunneling between two metallic electrodes, 
			separated by a vacuum region. The potential in the vacuum region acts as a barrier to electrons. In this 
      		simplified form, one can apply the solution of the Schrodinger equation, 
      		applied to a rectangular barrier: psi = exp{kx}, 
			where k = sqrt[2m(Vb - E)/(h2)] where, Vb represents the barrier potential, E is the energy of 
			the particular state, and h corresponds to the reduced Planck constant. In 
      		General, the tunneling current through the vacuum is proportional to the 
      		separation between the tip and the sample. An atomically sharp tip is 
      		used, the tunneling current from the first atom of the tip can be 
      		determined while the tip is scanned using piezo-electric nano-positioning 
      		probe and the measured tunneling current is numerically processed to an 
      		image.</p>

			<h2>NetOpt &ndash; Network Optimization Platform:</h2>
			<p><img src="Image10.gif" width="184" height="136"></p>
			<p><b>NetOpt</b> Network Optimization Platform and <b>NODAL</b> (Network Optimization, Design &amp; 
    		Analysis) Compiler (invented my own language). This is a software IDE 
    		platform specifically designed to explore network optimization algorithms. 
    		A specialized language was developed that allows quick implementation of 
    		various algorithms and also allows simple linking of C or C++ or other 
    		high level modules. </p>
