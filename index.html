        <h3>ESP8266 SDK</h3>
        <p>EASY PEASY ESP8266 SDK This is a super simple to use SDK for the ESP8266. This SDK is designed to work on Windows 7
        or higher machines without the need to install anything, no Virtual Machines, No Linux or anything else, just download 
        and unzip to a directory and away you go. It includes some good example apps with source code.

        <h3>The yPU SoC Development Environtment</h3>
        <p>Synthetic System on a Chip generator, complete CPU on an FPGA that can be synthisized, 
        after using a super simple, user friendly GUI to pick all the peripherals that you want on your SoC. Simply drag 
        and drop the desired resources to your target, compile and download and you have the perfect chip for you app. any combination of RS232 ports, PWM, 
        LCD, GPIO, SPI, SD card and so on. (sorry no github files yet, 
        waiting on some legalities). Try it and see: <a href="http://ypumaker.azurewebsites.net/" target="ypu maker">ypu maker</a>

        <h3>zPhone Project</h3>
		<p>The purpose of the "zPhone Project" is to create a hand held Ultra-Thin Client device 
    	operating over a wireless connection such as WiFi or 4G. An Ultra-Thin Client (UTC) is 
        a client implemented in hardware (FPGA). thin client has no intelligence or computing power of 
        its own and hence, relies completely a server for operation. Because the  UTC is 
        completely hardware, the cost and power consumption of the device are drastically reduced 
        (no software licensing for OS or programming), everything runs completely virtualized in the cloud!

        <h3>Scanning Tunneling Microscope</h3>
        <p>A device by which atoms may be imaged using the Quantum Tunneling effect. STM involves the tunneling of electrons through 
        gap from the tip of the STM to the sample. This can be considered as tunneling between two metallic electrodes, 
		separated by a vacuum region. The potential in the vacuum region acts as a barrier to electrons. In this 
      	simplified form, one can apply the solution of the Schrodinger equation, applied to a rectangular barrier: psi = exp{kx}, 
		where k = sqrt[2m(Vb - E)/(h2)] where, Vb represents the barrier potential, E is the energy of the particular state, and 
        h corresponds to the reduced Planck constant. In General, the tunneling current through the vacuum is proportional to the 
      	separation between the tip and the sample. An atomically sharp tip is used, the tunneling current from the first atom of the tip can be 
   		determined while the tip is scanned using piezo-electric nano-positioning probe and the measured tunneling current is numerically processed to an 
   		image. ---><img src="Image8.gif" width="46" height="46">

        <h3>Zero Board Computer</h3>
        <p>ZBC is a PC-AT Clone implemented as anSoC (System on a Chip) using the Altera Cyclone III FPGA. ZBC 
    	is intended to be fun and educational and able to run DOS and uCLinux. The motivation for this project was to 
        emulate the Intel 80186 CPU using Verilog HDL and to synthesis a working computer by utilizing custom and 
      	open source (<a href="http://www.opencores.org/">www.opencores.org</a> peripheral IP Cores (Intellectual Property) 
        to form a complete bootable OS from an SD Card rather than a hard drive. 
        </p> 
	  	<p>The completed project also implemented complete TCP/IP,UDP,HTTP,FTP,ARP,ICMP 
	  	stack in a driver called TinySOCK I developed using nothing but RFC's.

        <h3>Roto-Cell 2000</h3>
        <p>The Roto-Cell 2000 is just a fun project that uses an old style Rotary Phone with the original internal 
        components removed and replaced with a cell phone bluetooth adapter mounted on a PCB board and a 
        micro-controller to interface the old style dialer and ringer. The microcontroller translates the 
        rotary dialed digits into RS232 commands that are sent to the Bluetooth adapter to make a call and 
        also receives messages from the Bluetooth adapter when a call comes in and rings the original bell. 
        </p>
        <p>The Audio interface converts the old style carbon mic in the phone to the necessary levels to interface to 
        a PCM Codec implemented on an FPGA along with the Bluetooth stack. You just pair it with whatever cell phone 
        you want, you put your phone in your pocket and now you have yourself a wireless Rotary phone! 
        For this project I used an old timey rotary phone that I bought at a garage sale.

        <h3>Apollo Guidance Computer Replica</h3>
        <p> <i class="icon-desktop "></i>The AGC (Apollo Guidance Computer) was a very early computer, 
        designed in 1964, it was the first to use Integrated Circuits and the first modern embedded 
        processor. Implemented using FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) that can think 
	  	of that as the equivalent of thousands of the TTL chips that is endlessly and completely 
  		reconfigurable.  I used the Altera Cyclone FPGA which has a lot of memory right on the FPGA. 
  		I also developed the user interface using a custom LCD controller using a CLPD and a 
  		Microcontroller with a USB interface so code can be downloaded from your PC. 
    	You can check out the source on this one at:

        <h3>FPGA SDR</h3>
        <p> <i class="icon-desktop "></i> 
        A Software Defined Radio was simulated and synthesized  using Verilog HDL and implemented 
        in a prototype set up. The design demonstrated OFDM modulation scheme to transmit video 
        images and further demonstrated that is software reconfigurable by altering in software to 
        transmit NTSC video over standard broadcast or FM Radio. This project was used for Masters EE 
        program project and was implemented using an FPGA and an embedded MCU.

        <h3>TabX1 Open Tablet Project</h3>
        <p> <i class="icon-desktop "></i> 
		TabX1 is an open source Linux based tablet computer. The idea behind it is to create a functional
		tablet at a very low cost using a low cost low power SoC ARM chip and de-load much of the processing 
        to an attached FPGA chip. TabX1 is running Linux 3 with Busybox Filesystem, X11 Xwindows, Fluxbox 
        desktop and I am using Rox Filer and Netsurf browser. It has 5.7" Color LCD display with 
        Touchscreen, Mouse, Keyboard, 100BaseT, USB Host port, Wifi, 4G wireless, custom graphics 
        driver (implemented on FPGA along with custom audio driver on FPGA), USB device, 4 RS232 ports, 
        32 GPIO lines Accellerometer, RTC, 64MBytes system RAM, SD card for disk, 128MB graphics RAM
