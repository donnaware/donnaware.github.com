<b><font size="2"><p>The "zPhone Project":</b> The purpose of the 
      "zPhone Project" is to create a hand held Ultra-Thin Client device 
      operating over a wireless connection such as WiFi or 3G/4G high speed 
      wireless. An Ultra-Thin Client (UTC) is a client implemented in hardware. 
      A thin client has no intelligence or computing power of its own and hence, 
      relies completely on it’s server for operation. </p>
<p>The concept of a UTC is to implement the client completely in hardware, specifically an FPGA to reduce the cost and power consumption of the device. A hardware implementation reduces cost since no software licensing, operating system costs or programming costs are incurred for the device itself. </p>
<p>The power consumption is reduced since there is no need for a high speed microprocessor and associated storage, memory and other support peripherals. The end result being that battery life is greatly enhanced. The highest power consumption is incurred from the RF section. For this project, an 802.11b mini-PCMIA interface card is selected. The 802.11b has reduced power consumption over 802.11g/n because b uses a CDMA air interface which has a much lower spectral density than the OFDMA scheme used by g/n.</p></font><font face="Arial" size="2"></font></td>

<b><font size="2"><p>FPGA Based Software Defined Radio: </b>An FPGA 
      consists of a large array of Logic Elements (LE). Each LE contains basic 
      building block of digital logic circuits (AND, OR, Flip Flop, etc). These 
      arrays can be in the range of 10K – 100K or more LE’s. Other types of 
      blocks may also be on the FPGA chip such as dedicated multipliers 
      (important for DSP applications) or RAM and sometimes embedded 
      microprocessor (e.g. ARM). All of the blocks can be arbitrarily 
      interconnected to each other via the re-programmable interconnection. The 
      challenge for the designer is to determine the optimal way to interconnect 
      these blocks to achieve the design goal. Many computer aided tools have 
      been developed to assist in this effort. </p>
<p>In this project, an SDR (Software Defined Radio) was simulated and synthesized using Verilog HDL and implemented in a prototype set up. The design demonstrated OFDM modulation scheme to transmit video images and further demonstrated that is software reconfigurable by altering in software to transmit NTSC video over standard broadcast.  This project was used for Masters EE program project.</p></font><font face="Arial" size="2"></font></td>

<b><font size="2"><p>Apollo Guidance Computer replica: </b>AGC 
      implemented using an FPGA.</p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="2"><p>The AGC (Apollo Guidance Computer) was a very early computer, designed in 1964, it was the first to use Integrated Circuits and the first modern embedded processor. When I was growing up, about 11 years old, I remember the Apollo program was fascinating to me and I had my eyes glued to the TV for days on end. The Moon landing made such a lasting impression on me that it is why I decided to go to engineering school and get a degree in Electrical Engineering. I used an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) that can think of that as the equivalent of thousands of the TTL chips that is endlessly and completely reconfigurable.  I used the Altera Cyclone FPGA which has a lot of memory right on the FPGA.  I also developed the user interface using a custom LCD controller using a CLPD and a Microcontroller with a USB interface so code can be downloaded from your PC. </font><a href="https://github.com/donnaware/AGC"><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="2">https://github.com/donnaware/AGC</font></a></p></td>

<b><font size="2"><p>The Zero Board Computer: </b>ZBC is a PC-XT SoC 
      (System on a Chip) that is implemented on an Altera Cyclone III FPGA. ZBC 
      is intended to be fun and educational and able to run DOS and uCLinux. The 
      motivation for this project was to emulate the Intel 80186 CPU using 
      Verilog HDL and to synthesis a working computer by utilizing custom and 
      open source (</font><a href="http://www.opencores.org/"><font size="1">www.opencores.org</font></a><font size="2">) peripheral IP Cores (Intellectual Property) to form a complete bootable SoC. The completed project also implemented complete TCP/IP,UDP,HTTP,FTP,ARP,ICMP stack in a driver called TinySOCK developed by me. </font><a href="http://github.com/donnaware/ZBC---The-Zero-Board-Computer"><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="2">http://github.com/donnaware/ZBC---The-Zero-Board-Computer</font></a></p>

<b><font size="2"><p>Roto-Cell 2000:</b> Roto-Cell is just a fun project 
      that uses </font><font size="3">an old style Rotary Phone with the original internal electronic components removed and replaced with a small cell phone main board and a micro-controller to interface the old style dialer and ringer to the cell phone data interface.   For this project I used an old cell phone that I had laying around and an old timey rotary phone that I bought at a garage sale. The cell phone I used  is an LG VX3300 flip phone.  But you can probably use just about any more recent models.  Most cell phones have a "data Interface" that is basically an RS232 interface that uses the Modem "AT" command set to control it. </font></p></td>

<b><font size="2"><p>Scanning Tunneling Microscope:</b> Scanning 
      Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is a process by which atoms may be imaged using 
      tunneling theory. STM involves the tunneling of electrons through gap from 
      the tip of the STM to the sample. This can be considered as tunneling 
      between two metallic electrodes, separated by a vacuum region. The 
      potential in the vacuum region acts as a barrier to electrons. In this 
      simplified form, one can apply the solution of the Schrodinger equation, 
      applied to a rectangular barrier: psi = exp{kx}, where k = sqrt[2m(Vb - 
      E)/(h2)] where, Vb represents the barrier potential, E is the energy of 
      the particular state, and h corresponds to the reduced Planck constant. In 
      General, the tunneling current through the vacuum is proportional to the 
      separation between the tip and the sample. An atomically sharp tip is 
      used, the tunneling current from the first atom of the tip can be 
      determined while the tip is scanned using piezo-electric nano-positioning 
      probe and the measured tunneling current is numerically processed to an 
      image.</font></p></td>

<b><font size="2"><p>NetOpt</b> Network Optimization Platform and <b>NODAL</b> (Network Optimization, Design &amp; 
      Analysis) Compiler (invented my own language). This is a software IDE 
      platform specifically designed to explore network optimization algorithms. 
      A specialized language was developed that allows quick implementation of 
      various algorithms and also allows simple linking of C or C++ or other 
      high level modules. </p></font></td>
